### app.R
This repository holds an app.R file used to launch an RStudio shiny app. The app is also hosted on shinyapps.io (temporarily) [https://sjones9.shinyapps.io/project2/](https://sjones9.shinyapps.io/project2/).

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is to provide a user-friendly interface to explore the Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior Dataset.

The app contains a sidebar panel and a main window. In the sidebar panel is a method of subsetting the data.
In the main window, the user can view instructions for using the app, a way to download the data (subset possibly), and visualize/summarize through plots and tables.
